# Edyoda-stories
A replica of Edyoda stories using HTML and CSS

I have created this project in such a way that even if we shrink the window or change the resolution a little, things remain intact and everything works seemlessly.

The whole project is designed in HTML and CSS.

I also used Font Awesome 4.7.0 icons for integrating icons in the project.

All the images in the URL are now proper URLs and they don't need to be downloaded separately.

I have also made some classes in CSS in such a way that we can reuse them while further development of the same.
